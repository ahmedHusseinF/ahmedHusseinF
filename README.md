## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Probably you know my name by now, this is some stuff about me.

- a nerd in the wild.
- an internetovert.
- under-estimate but over-perform.
- swimming is the best sport and football (both actually) sucks.
- fun fact: There are 1 million ants for every human in the world.
- Ask me about anything with a ones and zeros.
